    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an enthusiastic Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I have hands-on experience with languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Spring Boot.
      My areas of interest include web development, cloud computing, databases, and system design. I love turning ideas into functional applications and pay attention to creating clean, efficient, and scalable code.
      Beyond coding, I stay curious about emerging trends in AI, blockchain, and DevOps practices, which helps me keep my development approach future-ready. I also enjoy collaborating in teams, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously enhancing my problem-solving skills through coding competitions and hackathons.
